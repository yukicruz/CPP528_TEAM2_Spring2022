### Lab-04
<br>
Part 1 of lab-04 completed data wrangling to produce the neeced dataset for analysis, including  change in median home value (MHV) from 2000 to 2010.
<br>
<br>
Part 2 explored the three variables selected to predict MHV change from gentrification:
- Percent white residents in 2000 (p.white.00)
- Percent with 4-year college education or more (p.col.edu.00)
- Poverty rate in 2000 (pov.rate.00)
<br> 
<br>
Variables were inspected for skew and logged if necessary to establish a normal distribution, then checked for multicollinearity. Regression models including metro-level fixed effects were run to test for the effect of the three predictor variables.
