## Results

#### New Market Tax Credit Investments(NMTC)

In the model without any control variables added, *New Market Tax Credit* investments had a significant effect on median home values, with the value of homes in tracts that received NMTC investments *increasing* less than those in tracts without NMTC. The median house value was $5892.20 less in 2010 data than would be expected if NMTC investments were not made. However, because NMTC are only allowed in tracts identified because of poverty or low family incomes, this finding seems likely to be the result of confounding variables such as poverty.

We chose the following variables of interest: Percent white residents in 2000, Percent with 4-year college education or more, and Poverty rate in 2000; to predict if the New Market Tax Credit investments had a significant effect on median home value. 

When the above control variables were included in 2000 as controls, we found that;  New Market Tax Credits had *a significant effect on median home value*. New Market Tax Credits resulted in a median home value of $166,560.50, an increase of **$7681** over the expected value if New Market Tax Credits had not been utilized

#### Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program(LIHTC)

In the model, which does not include any control variables, the *Low Income Housing Tax Credit* program did *not* have a significant effect on median home values from 2000 to 2010. Similar to the New Market Tax Credits, we included the chosen variables of interest; Percent white residents in 2000, Percent with 4-year college education or more, and Poverty rate in 2000 to predict if the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program had a significant effect on median home value. The results again showed that, the Low Income Housing Tax Credits *did not have a significant effect on median home values.* In this model, median home price is nearly identical in tracts with or without LIHTC.

#### Reflection on Testing the parallel lines assumption in this mode

Examining longitudinal data from points before and/or after the timeframe in question would provide evidence that the parallel trends assumption is met, that both the treatment and control groups would have changed at the same rate in the absence of the treatment.

## Conclusion

We have developed models to  predict if the New Market Tax Credit (NMTC) program or Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program had a significant effect on median home value from 2000 to 2010. We chose Percent white residents in 2000, Percent with 4-year college education or more, and Poverty rate in 2000 as control variables. 

Results shown in the models were different. NMTC had significant effect to the medium home values--there was increase of $7681 . While the LIHTC did not had any impact to the medium home value--the results were same to the tract with no LIHTC program. The variables used significantly predicted to the median home value change for the tracts with NMTC  and LIHTC
