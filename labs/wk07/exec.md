## Overview/Research Questions and Program Details
This study sought to examine economic growth in neighborhoods, with an extra focus on Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We also compare two tax credit programs.

## Data
The data for this study comes from the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB), HUD Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) data, and New Market Tax Credit data (NMTC). See Chapter 1 for more information about how to access the data dictionary.

## Methods
We ran a regression model predicting change in median home value from 2000 to 2010. The independent variables selected were the percentage of white residents, percent of the population with 4 years of college education or more, and the poverty rate in 2000.
We also ran two difference-in-difference models with and without the control variables described above to examine the effect of the two interventionsâ€”New Market Tax Credit (NMTC) and Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC).

## Results
From our first model, each of the three variables chosen (percent white residents, percent with college or greater education level, and poverty rate) did significantly predict change in median home values from 2000 to 2010.
When the controls were included in the model, we found the New Market Tax Credit program had a significant effect on median home value. New Market Tax Credits resulted in a median home value of $166,560.50, an increase of $7681 over the expected value if New Market Tax Credits had not been utilized.
When the controls were included in the second model, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program did not have a significant effect on median home values. In this model, median home price was nearly identical in tracts with or without LIHTC.
